### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial Data Preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Data Loading and Inspection.
2. Handling Missing values.
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer few questions such as:
- What is the overall Sales Trend?
- What are the top selling and bottom selling products?
- What is the Overall Sales based on different regions?
- Who are the top and bottom salesman according to sales?


### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The Company's sales gets increased over a short period of time and then declines.
2. Printer is the best selling product.
3. Most Sales are done in the East Region.


### Recommendations
Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Try to build good Customer relations as the business is new, and we can see a pattern of increasing and decreasing of sales over specific periods.
-  Implement some strategies such as discounts, % of price off so that you can have more sales.


### Limitations
The data consisted of some spelling mistakes in the region section, so I had to replace the spellings and have a specific order to it. The data consisted of few records having no values, so we dropped those records. We need to calculate the sales based on Quantity and Price given.
