### Results/Findings
---
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The Company's sales increases at the end of the year and starting of the year.
2. Printer is the best selling product.
3. Most Sales are done in the East Region.


### Recommendations
---
Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Try to build good Customer relations as the business is new, and we can see a pattern of increasing and decreasing of sales over specific periods.
-  Implement some strategies such as discounts, % of price off so that you can have more sales.


### Limitations
---
As the Data was from a business that was recently started and only consisted of Data around a year, so analyzing it properly was also a challenge. The data consisted of some spelling mistakes in the region section, so I had to replace the spellings and have a specific order to it. The data consisted of few records having no values, so we dropped those records. We need to calculate the sales based on Quantity and Price given.
